Design a minimalist, eco-friendly dairy delivery app UI named "Krishna Chaitanya". The color scheme should include creamy whites, soft greens, and pastel blues with glass bottle illustrations, subtle farm icons, rounded corners, soft shadows, and modern typography. It should feel peaceful, clean, and fresh — inspired by nature and purity.
