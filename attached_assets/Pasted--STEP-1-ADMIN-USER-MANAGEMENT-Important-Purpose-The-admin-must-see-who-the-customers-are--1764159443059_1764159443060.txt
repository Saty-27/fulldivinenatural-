✅ STEP 1 — ADMIN USER MANAGEMENT (Important)

Purpose: The admin must see who the customers are.

📌 What to build:

Admin Page: /admin/customers

Admin can see:

Customer Name

Phone Number

Email

Number of Orders

Number of Subscriptions

Total Spending

Joined Date

📌 Backend APIs required:
GET /api/admin/customers
GET /api/admin/customers/:id/orders
GET /api/admin/customers/:id/subscriptions

📌 UI Elements:

Table with all customers

Search by name/phone

Filter: “Has Subscription / No Subscription”

Click → Open customer profile popup
Shows:

Basic details

Order history

Subscriptions

Addresses

⭐ This step is easy, fast, and makes your admin panel REAL.

✅ STEP 2 — ADVANCED ORDER MANAGEMENT

Your admin already shows orders, BUT you now need real backend controls like:

📌 What to add:

Change status
PLACED → PREPARING → OUT FOR DELIVERY → DELIVERED

Payment status
PAID / UNPAID / FAILED

Assign delivery partner (optional later)

Estimated delivery time

Print invoice PDF

Cancel order

📌 Backend APIs required:
PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status
PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/payment
PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/cancel
PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/assign-partner   (later)
GET /api/admin/orders/:id


⭐ This makes admin powerful — like Amazon Seller Panel.

🟧 STEP 3 — SUBSCRIPTION CONTROL (very important)

You already show subscriptions — now make them controllable.

📌 What to build:

Admin can:

Pause subscription

Resume subscription

Change quantity

Change time slot

See daily milk totals
(e.g., Today: 1,250 liters required)

📌 Backend APIs:
PUT /api/admin/subscriptions/:id/pause
PUT /api/admin/subscriptions/:id/resume
PUT /api/admin/subscriptions/:id/update
GET /api/admin/subscriptions/daily-requirement

📌 UI:

Subscription list

Buttons: Pause, Resume

Edit popup: Quantity, frequency, time slot

Daily milk requirement banner at top

⭐ This is the heart of the dairy business.

🟧 STEP 4 — INVENTORY CONTROL (Stock System Upgrade)

Currently stock reduces only during orders.
Now we add full admin inventory controls.

📌 What to build:

Admin can:

Increase stock manually

Decrease stock (spoilage/wastage)

Set low-stock alert levels

Add product expiry date (optional)

View stock logs (history)

📌 Backend:
POST /api/admin/products/:id/stock/add
POST /api/admin/products/:id/stock/reduce
GET /api/admin/products/:id/stock-history

📌 UI:

“Add Stock” button

“Reduce Stock” button

History table

Color-coded levels

<20 = red

<50 = yellow

50 = green

⭐ This is real inventory system used by stores.
