This style guide is a complete re-imagination of your clean light theme, transforming it into a luxurious, premium, and aesthetically delightful interface. It aligns with your request for a smoother, more elegant feel and incorporates a rich "Indian context" through its color palette, subtle design elements, and fluid animations.

1. Core Visual Identity: The Divine Aura
The design moves beyond simple light and dark themes to embrace a concept of "Divine Light." The interface radiates warmth and elegance, creating a professional yet deeply satisfying user experience.

Color Palette: A departure from stark white, the base is a creamy, luxurious Linen White (#FBFBF2). This off-white provides a soft, warm canvas. The core accent colors are rich jewel tones inspired by Indian art and nature:

Primary Green: A deep, rich Emerald Green (#036666) for primary actions and highlights, symbolizing growth and prosperity.

Secondary Orange: A vibrant Saffron Gold (#FF9900) for accents and warnings, representing elegance and energy.

Accents: Subtle pops of a soft Ruby Red (#B53123) for critical alerts and a calming Sapphire Blue (#0F4C81) for informational elements.

Borders & Text: Borders are not stark lines, but a whisper of a warm gray (#E8E8D9). Primary text is a professional Dark Charcoal (#2C2F33), and muted text is a slightly warmer Medium Gray (#A0A0A0), ensuring perfect readability.

2. The Art of Soft Neumorphism & Glassmorphism
The UI is given a tactile, three-dimensional quality through a modern blend of soft neumorphism and elegant glassmorphism.

Cards (Neumorphic feel): The simple white cards are replaced with a "pushed-in" or "raised" effect. They are created with a soft, inset shadow and a corresponding subtle highlight, making them appear to be molded from the background surface itself. This gives each card a sense of presence and depth without being visually heavy. The corners are smoothly rounded at a large, 2xl radius.

Glassmorphism on Demand: Elements like notification modals, popovers, and interactive panels (e.g., live GPS tracking) will use a light glassmorphism effect. They will be semi-transparent and blurred, gracefully hovering over the content below and creating a sense of ethereal luxury.

Shadows: Heavy drop shadows are gone. Replaced by a diffused, soft-focus glow that adds a subtle halo effect to raised elements.

3. Animation & Micro-interactions: Silky Smooth & Seamless
The animations are designed to be a key feature, making every interaction feel like a premium experience. The transitions are fluid, effortless, and never overwhelming.

Hover Effects: A simple color change is a thing of the past.

Cards: On hover, cards will subtly and smoothly elevate, casting a slightly more pronounced, soft shadow.

Buttons: A gentle "press-in" effect. When clicked, the button will momentarily depress, providing satisfying and tactile feedback.

Navigation Items: A luminous glow, in the primary Emerald Green, will spread softly around the selected item.

Transitions: All transitions are set at a buttery smooth 400ms duration with a custom ease-in-out curve. This applies to sidebar collapse/expand, modal fade-ins, and page changes.

Chart & Data Animation:

Line & Bar Charts: When a chart loads, the lines will "grow" dynamically, and bars will "fill up" with a smooth, fluid animation.

Progress Rings: The rings on KPI cards will fill with a gentle, graceful sweep, providing a visual celebration of progress.

4. Typography & Icons: A Touch of Tradition, A Lot of Modernism
A dual-font system is used to add a layer of sophistication.

Header Font: An elegant, medium-weight Serif font (e.g., Lora or Playfair Display) is used for all main section headers (Dashboard Overview, Vendors Management, etc.). This adds a classic, luxurious feel.

Body Font: The clean, modern Inter or Poppins is retained for all body text, ensuring legibility and consistency.

Icons: All icons from Lucide React will be styled to match the theme. Active icons will be in Emerald Green or Saffron Gold, while inactive icons are in the soft gray of the muted text.

5. Indian Context in UI Design
The "Indian context" is woven into the UI in a subtle, yet impactful manner, beyond just the color palette.

Analytics & Data Presentation: Charts and graphs will feature dual-toned data lines or bars, blending from a darker shade to a lighter one, reminiscent of hand-woven fabrics. The data points will not be simple dots, but subtle, glowing markers.

Decorative Accents: On key sections, like the dashboard, a subtle, almost transparent pattern—reminiscent of a minimalist "rangoli" or a "mandala" design—will be placed in the background to add a cultural, artistic touch without distracting from the data.

Loading States: Skeleton screens for loading data will not be harsh gray boxes. They will be soft, pulsing shapes that feel organic and seamless, maintaining the overall theme of grace and elegance.
