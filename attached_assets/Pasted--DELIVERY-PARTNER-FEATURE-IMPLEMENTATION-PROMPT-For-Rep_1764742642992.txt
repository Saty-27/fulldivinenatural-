🎯 FINAL READY-TO-PASTE REPLIT PROMPT

Copy-paste this exact line into Replit:

Implement a Delivery Partner Onboarding & Verification System with the following rules:

ADMIN SIDE:
- Admin creates partner account with: Full Name, Phone Number, Zone, Vehicle Type, Status, Auto-Generated Username, Auto-Generated Password.
- Admin ONLY creates login credentials and does NOT upload documents.
- Admin later verifies all documents uploaded by partner.
- Admin can approve, reject, block, unblock, edit zone, update vehicle type, reset password, and view performance data.
- Admin sees “Verification Pending” until partner completes profile.

DELIVERY PARTNER SIDE:
- When partner logs in first time, force “Profile Completion Page”.
- Partner must upload: Personal Details, Address, Aadhaar (number + front/back), PAN (number + photo), Driving License (number + front/back + validity), Vehicle Details (number plate + RC + insurance), Bank Details (account number + IFSC + bank name + passbook photo).
- Partner must tick: “Documents are genuine” and “Agree to terms”.
- After submission, partner status becomes “Verification Pending”.
- Partner cannot accept deliveries until Admin verifies them.

FLOW:
Admin creates → Partner logs in → Partner submits documents → Admin verifies → Partner becomes Verified → Partner can deliver.
