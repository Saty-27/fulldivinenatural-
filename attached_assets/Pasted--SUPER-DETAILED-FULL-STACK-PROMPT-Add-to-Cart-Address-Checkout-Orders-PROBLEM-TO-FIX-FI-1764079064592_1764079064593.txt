✅ 🔥 SUPER DETAILED FULL-STACK PROMPT: Add to Cart → Address → Checkout → Orders
❗ PROBLEM TO FIX FIRST

When user clicks Add to Cart or Buy Now, it shows:

❌ “Failed to add to cart”

This happens because API is missing / broken / not connected.

We must create & connect all cart APIs properly.

✅ 📌 STEP 5 — ADD TO CART (FIX NOW)
🔧 What must be implemented
1️⃣ Database Model (cart table)

Each cart item must store:

Field	Description
id	PK
user_id	Which customer added product
product_id	Which product
quantity	How many units
price	Snapshot of price
created_at	Timestamp
updated_at	Timestamp
2️⃣ Backend APIs required (this MUST exist)
📌 1. Add Item to Cart

POST /api/cart

Request:

{
  "productId": "123",
  "quantity": 2
}


Response (Success):

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Item added to cart",
  "cartItem": { ... }
}


Response (Fail):

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Product not found"
}

📌 2. Get User Cart

GET /api/cart

Return ALL cart items for user.

📌 3. Update Cart Item

PUT /api/cart/:id

Update quantity.

📌 4. Remove Cart Item

DELETE /api/cart/:id

Delete item from cart.

3️⃣ Frontend Work (React)
When user clicks Add to Cart

Send POST → /api/cart

If success:

Show success toast

Update cart badge

If fail:

Show error toast

When user clicks Buy Now

Add to cart

Redirect → /checkout

4️⃣ Testing (You MUST test)
Test Case 1

Click Add to Cart
→ Should NOT show “Failed to add to cart”

Test Case 2

Open /cart
→ items must appear

Test Case 3

Increase quantity
→ subtotal auto updates

❗ After ADD TO CART is working, next features:
✅ 📌 STEP 6 — DELIVERY ADDRESS SYSTEM
Backend APIs Needed
POST   /api/address        → Add address  
GET    /api/address        → Get all addresses of user  
PUT    /api/address/:id    → Edit  
DELETE /api/address/:id    → Delete  
PUT    /api/address/:id/default → Mark as default  

Frontend Screens
✔ Add New Address Form

Name

Phone

House number

Street

Landmark

City

Pincode

Make default (checkbox)

✔ Address List Page

Show all saved addresses

Edit / Delete buttons

📌 STEP 7 — CHECKOUT FLOW
User should:

✔ Select Delivery Address
✔ Select Payment Mode
✔ See Cart Summary
✔ See Delivery Charges
✔ Place Order

Backend:

POST /api/orders

Payload:

{
  "addressId": "123",
  "items": [
    { "productId": "123", "quantity": 2 }
  ],
  "paymentMethod": "COD"
}

Stock Reduction Logic

When order placed:

product.stock = product.stock - quantity

📌 STEP 8 — MY ORDERS PAGE
Backend APIs needed
GET /api/orders/me      → All my orders
GET /api/orders/:id     → Single order details

Order Status UI:

Pending

Confirmed

Packed

Out for Delivery

Delivered

Cancelled

🚀 FINAL ADMIN ROADMAP (AFTER USER FEATURES)
1️⃣ Product Management (Done)
2️⃣ Cart System (CURRENT TASK)
3️⃣ Address System
4️⃣ Order Management
5️⃣ Stock Auto Update
6️⃣ Subscriptions
7️⃣ Delivery Partner
8️⃣ Wallet / Offers / Notifications
