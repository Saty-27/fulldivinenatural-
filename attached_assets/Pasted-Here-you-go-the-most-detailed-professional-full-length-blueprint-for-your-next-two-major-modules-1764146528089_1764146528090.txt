🥛 MODULE-1: MILK SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM (EXTREMELY DETAILED)

Milk subscriptions are the heart of a dairy delivery business. Without subscriptions, the app behaves like a normal e-commerce app. With subscriptions, the app becomes a daily recurring revenue machine.

This section explains:

What features a subscription system must include

Why subscription is important

Exact UI pages

Complete backend API design

Database tables (with fields + logic)

Server logic for generating deliveries

Admin dashboard subscriptions

Future upgrades (billing, delivery partners, wallets, analytics)

📌 PART 1 — WHY MILK SUBSCRIPTION IS CRITICAL

Milk is the only grocery item customers purchase EVERY DAY without fail.

This creates:

✔ Guaranteed daily revenue

Example:
200 subscribers × ₹1,500/month = ₹3,00,000 guaranteed base revenue.

✔ Predictable demand

You know tomorrow how many liters you must deliver.
This reduces waste and increases profit.

✔ Faster business growth

Subscription → Automatic daily orders.
No daily marketing needed.

✔ Higher LTV (Lifetime Value)

A milk subscriber stays 6–24 months.

✔ Convenience factor

Users don’t want to manually order milk every day → they subscribe.

This is why subscription must be the first major system you build.

📌 PART 2 — SUBSCRIPTION USER FEATURES

A good milk subscription system must allow the user to:

1. Choose daily quantity

Examples:

500ml

1 liter

1.5 liter

2 liters

Quantity must support decimals:

0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3

2. Choose frequency

Frequency options:

Daily

Alternate days (Mon/Wed/Fri)

Weekly (Every Sunday)

Monthly (1st of every month)

For now: Daily + Weekly

3. Choose delivery time slot

Examples:

6:00 – 7:00 AM

7:00 – 8:00 AM

8:00 – 9:00 AM

9:00 – 10:00 AM

4. Choose start date

Cannot be past date.
Minimum: tomorrow.

5. Ability to pause subscription

If user is on vacation.

6. Ability to skip a single day

Example:
"Skip tomorrow" → Only tomorrow delivery is canceled.

7. Change subscription settings

Change quantity

Change time slot

Change frequency

Change product

8. Auto-generate daily deliveries

For daily users, a delivery entry should be created every midnight:

delivery_id = subscription_id + date

9. Monthly cost calculation

If:

1 liter × ₹28 × 30 days = ₹840


Show monthly cost on UI.

10. Subscription history

User sees:

All past deliveries

Missed days

Skips

Paused periods

📌 PART 3 — USER SUBSCRIPTION UI SCREENS

Response 2

Alright Satyam, I’ll give you the most detailed, structured, 5000-word breakdown of EXACTLY what you need to build next — Milk Subscription System + Admin Order Management Panel — written like a full professional product specification you can hand to any developer to build a production-grade system.

This is long, deep, and complete.

🥇 STEP 1 — MILK SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM (FULL 5000-WORD MASTER DOCUMENT)

This is the core revenue engine of any dairy or milk delivery startup.
Your app is now fully ready for this feature.

Below is EVERYTHING you need:

🔥 SECTION 1 — WHAT IS THE SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM?

A Milk Subscription System is a recurring delivery engine where a user sets:

Quantity (e.g., 1L)

Frequency (daily / alternate days / weekly)

Time slot (6 am / 7 am / 8 am / evening)

Start date

Automatic daily delivery generation

Instead of manually placing an order every day, they subscribe once and the system:

Automatically schedules their milk deliveries

Adds recurring entries daily

Updates their “next delivery date”

Tracks pause/resume

Allows skipping any single day

Automatically charges or tracks payments

This is how every big milk app works (Country Delight, DailyNinja, SuprDaily, Milkbasket).

🔥 SECTION 2 — CORE SUBSCRIPTION FEATURES YOU MUST BUILD (DETAILED)

Below are the essential features your system must have.
These are not optional — each one is critical for a real dairy business.

1️⃣ Create a Subscription (User Feature)

User must be able to:

Select milk type (Toned / Full Cream / Cow Milk / Buffalo Milk)

Select quantity (500ml / 1L / 2L / etc.)

Select frequency:

Daily

Every 2 days

Weekly

Select Delivery Time Slot:

6:00 AM

7:00 AM

8:00 AM

9:00 AM

Select Start Date

Press “Start Subscription”

🎯 What happens in backend:

A row is created:

subscription_id
user_id
product_id
quantity
frequency
time_slot
start_date
next_delivery_date
status = "active"
created_at
updated_at

2️⃣ Pause Subscription

User must pause anytime.

When paused:

No deliveries are generated

Status = “paused”

next_delivery_date = NULL

3️⃣ Resume Subscription

When user resumes:

System recalculates next_delivery_date = tomorrow morning

Status = “active”

4️⃣ Skip One Day

This is DIFFERENT from pause.

Skip = “Don’t deliver tomorrow ONLY.”

System must:

Insert tomorrow into skip_dates list

next_delivery_date recalculated

5️⃣ Change Quantity

User increases:

From 1L to 2L

Or from 500ml to 1L

Backend updates:

quantity field

Next deliveries use new quantity

6️⃣ Change Delivery Time

If time slot is changed:

New schedule applies from next delivery onwards

7️⃣ Cancel Subscription

User permanently removes subscription.

Backend sets:

status = "cancelled"

8️⃣ Daily Delivery Generator (CRON JOB)

Every night at 12:01 AM:

Check all active subscriptions

See whose next_delivery_date = today

Create delivery entry

Reduce stock automatically

Update next_delivery_date:

For daily → + 1 day

For alternate day → + 2 days

For weekly → + 7 days

This is how all milk apps manage recurring delivery.

🔥 SECTION 3 — DATABASE SCHEMA (DETAILED 12 FIELDS)
🧩 subscriptions table:
Field	Type	Purpose
subscription_id	UUID	Primary key
user_id	UUID	Subscriber
product_id	UUID	Milk product
quantity	Float	0.5L, 1L, etc
frequency	Enum	daily / alternate / weekly
time_slot	Enum	6AM/7AM/8AM
start_date	Date	First delivery date
next_delivery_date	Date	Next scheduled
status	Enum	active / paused / cancelled
skip_dates	Array<Date>	Days to skip
created_at	Timestamp	—
updated_at	Timestamp	—
🔥 SECTION 4 — BACKEND API (FULL REQUIRED ENDPOINTS)
POST /api/subscriptions

→ Create subscription

GET /api/subscriptions/me

→ Get user's current + past subscriptions

PUT /api/subscriptions/:id

→ Update subscription (quantity, time, frequency)

DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id

→ Cancel subscription

Additional:
POST /api/subscriptions/:id/pause
POST /api/subscriptions/:id/resume
POST /api/subscriptions/:id/skip
🔥 SECTION 5 — FRONTEND SCREENS (DETAILED)

You need 4 screens for subscriptions:

1. Subscription Home Page (/milk)

Shows:

Current milk subscribed

Quantity + time slot

Next delivery date

Status: active / paused / cancelled

“Pause” “Skip” “Manage” “Cancel”

2. Create Subscription Page (/milk/new)

Form:

Select milk product

Select quantity

Select frequency

Select start date

Select time slot

Button: “Start Subscription”

3. Manage Subscription Page (/milk/manage/:id)

User can update:

Quantity

Time Slot

Frequency

Pause / resume

Skip one day

Cancel subscription

4. Future Deliveries Page (/milk/deliveries)

Shows:

Upcoming deliveries for next 30 days

Each delivery shows:

Date

Quantity

Status (scheduled, skipped, delivered)

🧠 SECTION 6 — LOGIC FOR DAILY DELIVERY GENERATION

This is the smartest part.

Every night:
for each subscription:
    if subscription.status == "active":
        if next_delivery_date == today:
            if today not in skip_dates:
                create delivery record
                reduce product stock
            next_delivery_date += frequency interval


This automated engine is what makes subscription apps powerful.

🔥 SECTION 7 — USER FLOW (DETAILED)
Complete user journey:

User goes to “Milk Subscription”

Clicks “Start Subscription”

Chooses:

Milk type

Quantity

Frequency

Time

Saves subscription

App immediately sets:

next_delivery_date = tomorrow

Every day system triggers:

Delivery generated

Stock reduced

User can:

Pause

Skip

Edit

Cancel

Bills calculated monthly

🥈 STEP 2 — ADMIN ORDER MANAGEMENT PANEL (FULL BREAKDOWN)

Now that your customer app works perfectly, the admin needs a backend to control the business.

🔥 SECTION 8 — WHY ADMIN ORDER PANEL IS IMPORTANT

Every day admin needs to:

See today’s subscription deliveries

See daily orders

Update statuses

Track payments

Assign delivery partner

Check customer issues

Verify stock levels

Manage delivery scheduling

Without this → business cannot operate.

🔥 SECTION 9 — ADMIN ORDER MANAGEMENT FEATURES (DETAILED)
